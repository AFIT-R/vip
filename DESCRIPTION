Description: A general framework for constructing variable importance plots from 
  various types machine learning models in R. Aside from some standard model-
  based variable importance measures, this package also provides newer novel 
  metrics based on partial dependence plots (PDPs) and individual conditional 
  expectation (ICE) curves described in Greenwell et al. (2018)
