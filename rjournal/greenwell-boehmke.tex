\author{by Brandon M. Greenwell, Bradley C. Boehmke}

\maketitle

\abstract{%
In the era of ``big data'', it is becoming more of a challenge to not
only build state-of-the-art predictive models, but also gain an
understanding of what's really going on in the data. For example, it is
often of interest to know which, if any, of the predictors in a fitted
model are relatively influential on the predicted outcome. Some modern
algorithms---like random forests (RFs) and gradient boosted decision
trees (GBMs)---have a natural way of quantifying the importance or
relative influence of each feature. Other algorithms---like naive Bayes
classifiers and support vector machines---are not capable of doing so
and \dfn{model-agnostic approaches} are generally used to measure each
predictor's importance. Enter \pkg{vip}, an R package for constructing
variable importance scores/plots for many types of supervised learning
algorithms using model-specific and novel model-agnostic approaches.
We'll also discuss a novel way to display both feature importance and
feature effects together using \dfn{sparklines}, a very small line chart
conveying the general shape or variation in some feature that can be
directly embedded in text or tables.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Formally define ``interpretabile'' and ``important''. The second
  edition of H2O's MLI book provides a useful citation and additional
  sources. Further, I think it's important in defining ``important'' to
  mean relative. These procedures can be applied to any model, so it's
  important to note that just because a feature appears more important
  relative to other features, it does not imply the feature is
  predictive (depends heavily on the usefulness of the model). The
  original scale of the importance scores is important to consider in
  this regard.
\item
  Take a hard look at the \textbf{mmpf} package which includes the
  ability to construct permutation importance. Additionally, use
  \textbf{pkgsearch} to hunt down more alternatives.
\item
  Discuss additional alternatives?
\item
  Discuss drawbacks of various methods in a single section. Maybe even
  show some examples? (e.g., high dimensional feature space, correlated
  features, etc.). Discuss ways to improve each procedure (e.g.,
  permuting within groups or using ALE/stratx plots instead and discuss
  plans to incorporate these into the package.)

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Too often machine learning (ML) models are summarized using a single
metric (e.g., cross-validated accuracy) and then put into production.
Although we often care about the predictions from these models, it is
becoming routine to also understand the predictions! Understanding how
an ML model makes its predictions helps build trust in the model and is
the fundamental idea of the emerging field of
\dfn{interpretable machine learning} (IML). For an in-depth discussion
on IML, see \citet{molnar-2019-iml}. In this paper, we focus on global
methods for quantifying the importance of features in an ML model.
Computing variable importance (VI) and communicating them through
variable importance plots (VIPs) is a fundamental component of IML and
is the main topic of this paper.

VI scores and VIPs can be constructed for general ML models using a
number of packages. The \CRANpkg{iml} package \citep{iml-pkg} provides
the \code{FeatureImp()} function which computes feature importance for
general prediction models using the permutation approach (discussed
later). It is written in \CRANpkg{R6} \citep{R6-pkg} and allows the user
to specify a generic loss function or select one from a pre-defined list
(e.g., \code{loss = "mse"} for mean squared error). It also allows the
user to specify whether importance is measured as the difference or as
the ratio of the original model error and the model error after
permutation. The user can also specify the number of repetitions used
when permuting each feature to help stabilize the variability in the
procedure.

The \CRANpkg{ingredients} package \citep{ingredients-pkg} also provides
permutation-based VI scores through the \code{feature\_importance()}
function. (Note that this function recently replaced the now deprecated
\CRANpkg{DALEX} function \code{variable\_importance()}
\citep{DALEX-pkg}.) Similar to \code{iml::FeatureImp()}, this function
allows the user to specify a loss function and how the importance scores
are computed (e.g., using the difference or ratio). It also provides an
option to sample the training data before shuffling the data to compute
importance (the default is to use \code{n\_sample = 1000}). This can
help speed up computation.

The \CRANpkg{caret} package \citep{caret-pkg} includes a general
\code{varImp()} function for computing model-specific and filter-based
VI scores. Filter-based approaches, which are described in
\citet{applied-kuhn-2013}, do not make use of the fitted model to
measure VI. They also do not take into account the other predictors in
the model. For regression problems, a popular filter-based approach to
measuring the VI of a numeric predictor \(x\) is to first fit a flexible
nonparametric model between \(x\) and the target \(Y\); for example, the
locally-weighted polynomial regression (LOWESS) method developed by
\citet{robust-cleveland-1979}. From this fit, a pseudo-\(R^2\) measure
can be obtained from the resulting residuals and used as a measure of
VI. For categorical predictors, a different method based on standard
statistical tests (e.g., \(t\)-tests and ANOVAs) can be employed; see
\citet{applied-kuhn-2013} for details. For classification problems, an
area under the ROC curve (AUC) statistic can be used to quantify
predictor importance. The AUC statistic is computed by using the
predictor \(x\) as input to the ROC curve. If \(x\) can reasonably
separate the classes of \(Y\), that is a clear indicator that \(x\) is
an important predictor (in terms of class separation) and this is
captured in the corresponding AUC statistic. For problems with more than
two classes, extensions of the ROC curve or a one-vs-all approach can be
used.

If you use the \CRANpkg{mlr} interface for fitting ML models
\citep{mlr-pkg}, then you can use the \code{getFeatureImportance()}
function to extract model-specific VI scores from various tree-based
models (e.g., RFs and GBMs). Unlike \pkg{caret}, the model needs to be
fit via the \pkg{mlr} interface; for instance, you cannot use
\code{getFeatureImportance()} on a \CRANpkg{gbm} model \citep{gbm-pkg}
unless it was fit using \pkg{mlr}.

While the \pkg{iml} and \pkg{DALEX} packages provide model-agnostic
approaches to computing VI, \pkg{caret}, and to some extent \pkg{mlr},
provide model-specific approaches (e.g., using the absolute value of the
\(t\)-statistic for linear models) as well less accurate filter-based
approaches . Furthermore, each package has a completely different
interface (e.g., \pkg{iml} is written in R6). The \CRANpkg{vip} package
\citep{vip-pkg} strives to provide a consistent interface to both
model-specific and model-agnostic approaches to feature importance that
is simple to use. The three most important functions exported by
\pkg{vip} are described below:

\begin{itemize}
 
  \item \code{vi()} computes VI scores using model-specific or model-agnostic approaches (the results are always returned as a tibble \citep{tibble-pkg});
  
  \item \code{vip()} constructs VIPs using model-specific or model-agnostic approaches with \CRANpkg{ggplot2}-style graphics \citep{ggplot2-pkg};
  
  \item \code{add\_sparklines()} adds a novel sparkline representation of feature effects (e.g., \dfn{partial dependence plots}) to any VI table produced by \code{vi()}.

\end{itemize}

There's also a function called \code{vint()} (for variable interactions)
but is experimental and will not be discussed here; the interested
reader is pointed to \citet{greenwell-simple-2018}. Note that
\code{vi()} is actually a wrapper around four workhorse functions,
\code{vi\_model()}, \code{vi\_ice()}, \code{vi\_pdp()}, and
\code{vi\_permute()}, that compute various types of VI scores. The first
computes model-specific VI scores, while the latter three produce
model-agnostic ones. The workhorse function that actually gets called is
controlled by the \code{method} argument in \code{vi()}; the default is
\code{method = "model"} which corresponds to model-specific VI (see
\code{?vip::vi} for details and links to further documentation).

\subsection{Constructing VIPs in R}\label{constructing-vips-in-r}}

We'll illustrate major concepts using the Friedman 1 benchmark problem
described in \citet{multivariate-friedman-1991} and
\citet{bagging-breiman-1996}:

\begin{equation}
  Y_i = 10 \sin\left(\pi X_{1i} X_{2i}\right) + 20 \left(X_{3i} - 0.5\right) ^ 2 + 10 X_{4i} + 5 X_{5i} + \epsilon_i, \quad i = 1, 2, \dots, n,
\label{eqn:friedman1}
\end{equation}

where \(\epsilon_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N\left(0, \sigma^2\right)\).
Data from this model can be generated using the
\code{vip::gen\_friedman()}. By default, the features consist of 10
independent variables uniformly distributed on the interval
\(\left[0,1\right]\); however, only 5 out of these 10 are actually used
in the true model. The code chunk below simulates 500 observations from
the model in Equation\textasciitilde{}\eqref{eqn:friedman1} with
\(\sigma = 1\); see \code{?vip::gen\_friedman} for details.

From Equation\textasciitilde{}\eqref{eqn:friedman1}, it should be clear
that features \(X_1\)--\(X_5\) are the most important! (The others don't
influence \(Y\) at all.) Also, based on the form of the model, we'd
expect \(X_4\) to be the most important feature, probably followed by
\(X_1\) and \(X_2\) (both comparably important), with \(X_5\) probably
less important. The influence of \(X_3\) is harder to determine due to
its quadratic nature, but it seems likely that this nonlinearity will
suppress the variable's influence over its observed range (i.e., 0--1).

\section{Model-specific VI}

Some machine learning algorithms have their own way of quantifying the
importance of each feature. We describe some of these in the subsections
that follow. The issue with model-specific VI scores is that they are
not necessarily comparable across different types of models. For
example, directly comparing the impurity-based VI scores from tree-based
models to the \(t\)-statistic from linear models.

\subsection{Decision trees and tree ensembles}

Decision trees probably offer the most natural model-specific approach
to quantifying the importance of each feature. In a binary decision
tree, at each node \(t\), a single predictor is used to partition the
data into two homogeneous groups. The chosen predictor is the one that
maximizes some measure of improvement \(i^t\). The relative importance
of predictor \(X\) is the sum of the squared improvements over all
internal nodes of the tree for which \(X\) was chosen as the
partitioning variable; see \citet{classification-breiman-1984} for
details. This idea also extends to ensembles of decision trees, such as
RFs and GBMs. In ensembles, the improvement score for each predictor is
averaged across all the trees in the ensemble. Fortunately, due to the
stabilizing effect of averaging, the improvement-based VI metric is
often more reliable in large ensembles; see
\citet[p. 368]{hastie-elements-2009}. RFs offer an additional method for
computing VI scores. The idea is to use the leftover out-of-bag (OOB)
data to construct validation-set errors for each tree. Then, each
predictor is randomly shuffled in the OOB data and the error is computed
again. The idea is that if variable \(X\) is important, then the
validation error will go up when \(X\) is perturbed in the OOB data. The
difference in the two errors is recorded for the OOB data then averaged
across all trees in the forest. Later on, we'll discuss a more general
permutation method that can be applied to any supervised learning model.

To illustrate, we fit a CART-like regression tree, RF, and GBM to the
simulated training data. (Note: there are a number of different packages
available for fitting these types of models, we just picked popular
implementations for illustration.)

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
# Load required packages
library(rpart)          # for fitting CART-like decision trees
library(randomForest)   # for fitting RFs
library(xgboost)        # for fitting GBMs

# Fit a single regression tree
tree <- rpart(y ~ ., data = trn)

# Fit an RF
set.seed(101)
rfo <- randomForest(y ~ ., data = trn, importance = TRUE)

# Fit a GBM
set.seed(102)
bst <- xgboost(
  data = data.matrix(subset(trn, select = -y)),
  label = trn$y, 
  objective = "reg:linear",
  nrounds = 100, 
  max_depth = 5, 
  eta = 0.3,
  verbose = 0  # suppress printing
)
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}

Each of the above packages include the ability to compute VI scores for
all the features in the model; however, the implementation is rather
package specific, as shown in the code chunk below. The results are
displayed in Figure \ref{fig:vi-plots} (the code to reproduce these
plots has been omitted but can be made available upon request).

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
# Extract VI scores from each model
vi_tree <- tree$variable.importance
vi_rfo <- rfo$variable.importance
vi_bst <- xgb.importance(model = bst)
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}

\end{figure}
\end{Schunk}

As we would expect, all three methods rank the variables
\code{x1}--\code{x5} as more important than the others. While this is
good news, it is unfortunate that we have to remember the different
functions and ways of extracting and plotting VI scores from various
model fitting functions. This is one place where \pkg{vip} can
help\ldots{}one function to rule them all! Once \pkg{vip} is loaded, we
can use \code{vi()} to extract a tibble of VI scores.

Notice how the \code{vi()} function always returns a
tibble\footnote{Technically, it's a tibble with an additional \code{"vi"} class.}
with two columns: \code{Variable} and \code{Importance} (the exceptions
are coefficient-based models which also include a \code{Sign} column
giving the sign of the corresponding coefficient and permutation
importance involving multiple Monte Carlo simulations, but more on that
later). Also, by default, \code{vi()} always orders the VI scores from
highest to lowest; this, among other options, can be controlled by the
user (see \code{?vip::vi} for details). Plotting VI scores with
\code{vip()} is just as straightforward. For example, the following code
can be used to reproduce Figure \ref{fig:vi-plots}.

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
p1 <- vip(tree) + ggtitle("Single tree")
p2 <- vip(rfo) + ggtitle("Random forest")
p3 <- vip(bst) + ggtitle("Gradient boosting")

# Figure 1
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, nrow = 1)
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}

Notice how the \code{vip()} function always returns a \code{"ggplot"}
object (by default, this will be a bar plot). For large models with many
features, a Cleveland dot plot is more effective (in fact, a number of
useful plotting options can be fiddled with). Below we call \code{vip()}
and change a few useful options (the resulting plot is displayed in
Figure \ref{fig:dot-plot}). Note that we can also call \code{vip()}
directly on a \code{"vi"} objects if it's already been constructed.

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
# Load required packages
library(ggplot2)  # for theme_light() function
theme_set(theme_light())  # set theme for all ggplot2-based plots

vip(bst, num_features = 5, geom = "point", horizontal = FALSE, 
    aesthetics = list(color = "red", shape = 17, size = 4))

\hypertarget{linear-models}{%
\subsection{Linear models}\label{linear-models}}

In multiple linear regression, or linear models (LMs), the absolute
value of the \(t\)-statistic (or some other scaled variant of the
estimated coefficients) is commonly used as a measure of VI. The same
idea also extends to generalized linear models (GLMs). In the code chunk
below, we fit an LM to the simulated \code{trn} data set allowing for
all main effects and two-way interactions, then use the \code{step()}
function to perform backward elimination. The resulting VIP is displayed
in Figure \ref{fig:vip-step}.

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
# Fit a LM
linmod <- lm(y ~ .^2, data = trn)
backward <- step(linmod, direction = "backward", trace = 0)

One issue with computing VI scores for LMs using the \(t\)-statistic
approach is that a score is assigned to each term in the model, rather
than to each individual feature! We can solve this problem using one of
the model-agnostic approaches discussed later.

Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), which were introduced
in \citet{multivariate-friedman-1991}, is an automatic regression
technique and can be seen as a generalization of LMs and GLMs. In the
MARS algorithm, the contribution (or VI score) for each predictor is
determined using a generalized cross-validation (GCV) statistic (though,
other statistics can also be used; see \code{?vip::vi\_model} for
details). An example using the \CRANpkg{earth} package \citep{earth-pkg}
is given below (the results are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:vip-earth}):

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
# Load required packages

\subsection{Neural networks}\label{neural-networks}}

For neural netwroks (NNs), two popular methods for constructing VI
scores are the Garson algorithm \citep{interpreting-garson-1991}, later
modified by \citet{back-goh-1995}, and the Olden algorithm
\citep{accurate-olden-2004}. For both algorithms, the basis of these VI
scores is the network's connection weights. The Garson algorithm
determines VI by identifying all weighted connections between the nodes
of interest. Olden's algorithm, on the other hand, uses the products of
the raw connection weights between each input and output neuron and sums
these products across all hidden neurons. This has been shown to
outperform the Garson method in various simulations. For DNNs, a similar
method due to \citet{data-gedeon-1997} considers the weights connecting
the input features to the first two hidden layers (for simplicity and
speed); but this method can be slow for large networks. We illustrate
these two methods below using \code{vip()} with the \CRANpkg{nnet}
package \citep{nnet-pkg} (see the results in Figure \ref{fig:vip-nnet}).

\section{Model-agnostic VI}

Model-agnostic interpredibility separates interpretation from the model.
Compared to model-specific approaches, model-agnostic VI methods are
more flexible and can be applied to any supervised learning algorithm.
In this section, we discuss model-agnostic methods for quantifying
global feature importance using three different approaches: 1) partial
dependence plots (PDPs), 2) \dfn{individual conditional expectation}
(ICE) curves, and 3) permutation-based feature importance. For specific
details on approaches 1)--2), see \citet{greenwell-simple-2018}.

\subsection{FIRM method}

Our first model-agnostic approach is based on a simple \emph{feature
importance ranking measure} (FIRM); for details, see
\citet{greenwell-simple-2018} and \citet{firm}. The specific approach
used here is based on quantifying the ``flatness'' of the effects of
each feature. Feature effects can be assessed using \emph{partial
dependence plots} (PDPs) or \emph{individual conditional expectation}
(ICE) curves. These approaches are model-agnostic and can be applied to
any supervised learning algorithm. PDPs and ICE curves help visualize
the effect of low cardinality subsets of the feature space on the
estimated prediction surface (e.g., main effects and two/three-way
interaction effects.). PDPs and ICE curves provide model-agnostic
interpretations and can be constructed in the same way for any
supervised learning algorithm. Below, we fit a projection pursuit
regression (PPR) model and construct PDPs for each feature using the
\CRANpkg{pdp} package \citet{greenwell-pdp-2017}. The results are
displayed in Figure \ref{fig:pdp-ppr}. Notice how the PDPs for the
uninformative features are relatively flat compared to the PDPs for
features \code{x1}--\code{x2}!

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{figure}[!htb]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{greenwell-boehmke_files/figure-latex/pdp-ppr-1} 

}

\caption[PDPs of main effects in the PPR model fit to the simulated Friedman data]{PDPs of main effects in the PPR model fit to the simulated Friedman data.}\label{fig:pdp-ppr}
\end{figure}
\end{Schunk}

Next, we compute PDP-based VI scores for the PPR and NN models. The PDP
method constructs VI scores that quantify the relative ``flatness'' of
each PDP (by default, this is defined by computing the standard
deviation of the \(y\)-axis values for each PDP). To use the PDP method,
specify \code{method = "firm"} in the call to \code{vi()} or
\code{vip()} (or just use \code{vi\_firm()} directly):

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
# Fit a PPR model (nterms was chosen using the caret package with 5 repeats of 
# 5-fold cross-validation)
pp <- ppr(y ~ ., data = trn, nterms = 11)  

# Plot VI scores
p1 <- vip(pp, method = "firm") + ggtitle("PPR")
p2 <- vip(nn, method = "firm") + ggtitle("NN")

# Figure 7
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
\end{Sinput}
\begin{figure}[!htb]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{greenwell-boehmke_files/figure-latex/pdp-ppr-nn-1} 

}

\caption[PDP-based feature importance for the PPR and NN models fit to the simulated Friedman data]{PDP-based feature importance for the PPR and NN models fit to the simulated Friedman data.}\label{fig:pdp-ppr-nn}
\end{figure}
\end{Schunk}

In Figure \ref{fig:pdp-ppr-nn} we display the PDP-based feature
importance for the previously obtained PPR and NN models. These VI
scores essentially capture the variability in the partial dependence
values for each main effect.

The ICE curve method is similar to the PDP method. The only difference
is that we measure the ``flatness'' of each ICE curve and then aggregate
the results (e.g., by averaging). If there are no (substantial)
interaction effects, using \code{ice = TRUE} will produce results
similar to using \code{ice = FALSE}. However, if strong interaction
effects are present, they can obfuscate the main effects and render the
PDP-based approach less useful (since the PDPs for important features
can be relatively flat when certain interactions are present; see
\citet{goldstein-peeking-2015} for details). In fact, it is probably
safest to always use \code{ice = TRUE} when using the FIRM method.

Below, we display the ICE curves for each feature in the PPR model using
the same \(y\)-axis scale; see Figure \ref{fig:ice-ppr}. Again, there is
a clear difference between the ICE curves for features
\code{x1}--\code{x5} and \code{x6}--\code{x10}; the later being
relatively flat by comparison. Also, notice how the ICE curves within
each feature are relatively parallel (if the ICE curves within each
feature were perfectly parallel, the standard deviation for each curve
would be the same and the results will be identical to the PDP method).
In this example, the interaction term between \code{x1} and \code{x2}
does not obfuscate the PDPs for the main effects and the results are not
much different.

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{figure}[!htb]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{greenwell-boehmke_files/figure-latex/ice-ppr-1} 

}

\caption[ICE curves for each feature in the PPR model fit to the simulated Friedman data]{ICE curves for each feature in the PPR model fit to the simulated Friedman data. The red curve represents the PDP (i.e., the averaged ICE curves).}\label{fig:ice-ppr}
\end{figure}
\end{Schunk}

Obtaining the ICE-based feature importance scores is also
straightforward, just specify \code{method = "ice"} in the call to
\code{vip::vi()} or \code{vip::vip()}. This is illustrated in the code
chunk below and the results are Figure \ref{fig:vip-ice-ppr-nn} are
similar to those obtained using the PDP method.

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
# Plot VI scores
p1 <- vip(pp, method = "firm", ice = TRUE) + ggtitle("PPR")
p2 <- vip(nn, method = "firm", ice = TRUE) + ggtitle("NN")

# Figure 9
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
\end{Sinput}
\begin{figure}[!htb]

\end{figure}
\end{Schunk}

When using \code{method = "firm"}, the feature effect values are stored
in an attribute called \code{"effects"}. This is a convenience so that
the feature effect plots (e.g., PDPs and ICE curves) can easily be
reconstructed and compared with the VI scores, as demonstrated in the
example below (see Figure \ref{fig:pdp-from-attr}):

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
# Construct PDP-based variable importance scores
(vis <- vi(pp, method = "firm"))
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}

\end{Schunk}

\subsection{Permutation method}

The permutation method exists in various forms and was made popular in
\citet{random-breiman-2001} for RFs, before being generalized and
extended in \citet{fisher-model-2018}. The permutation approach used in
\pkg{vip} is quite simple and is outlined in Algorithm \ref{alg:permute}
below. The idea is that if we randomly permute the values of an
important feature in the training data, the training performance would
degrade (since permuting the values of a feature effectively destroys
any relationship between that feature and the target variable). This of
course assumes that the model has been properly tuned (e.g., using
cross-validation) and is not over fitting. The permutation approach uses
the difference between some baseline performance measure (e.g., training
\(R^2\), AUC, or RMSE) and the same performance measure obtained after
permuting the values of a particular feature in the training data
(\strong{Note:} the model is NOT refit to the training data after
randomly permuting the values of a feature). It is also important to
note that this method may not be appropriate when you have, for example,
highly correlated features (since permuting one feature at a time may
lead to unlikely data instances).

Let \(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_j\) be the features of interest and let
\(\mathcal{M}_{orig}\) be the baseline performance metric for the
trained model; for brevity, we'll assume smaller is better (e.g.,
classification error or RMSE). The permutation-based importance scores
can be computed as follows:

\begin{algorithm}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item For $i = 1, 2, \dots, j$:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Permute the values of feature $X_i$ in the training data.
    \item Recompute the performance metric on the permuted data $\mathcal{M}_{perm}$.
    \item Record the difference from baseline using $imp\left(X_i\right) = \mathcal{M}_{perm} - \mathcal{M}_{orig}$.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Return the VI scores $imp\left(X_1\right), imp\left(X_2\right), \dots, imp\left(X_j\right)$.
\end{enumerate}
\caption{A simple algorithm for constructing permutation-based VI scores. \label{alg:permute}}
\end{algorithm}

Algorithm \ref{alg:permute} can be improved or modified in a number of
ways. For instance, the process can be repeated several times and the
results averaged together. This helps to provide more stable VI scores,
and also the opportunity to measure their variability. Rather than
taking the difference in step (c),
\citet[Chapter 5, Section 5.5.4]{molnar-2019-iml} argues that using the
ratio \(\mathcal{M}_{perm} / \mathcal{M}_{orig}\) makes the importance
scores more comparable across different problems. It's also possible to
assign importance scores to groups of features (e.g., by permuting more
than one feature at a time); this would be useful if features can be
categorized into mutually exclusive groups, for instance, categorical
features that have been \dfn{one-hot-encoded}.

To use the permutation approach in \pkg{vip}, specify
\code{method = "permute"} in the call to \code{vi()} or \code{vip()}.
Note that using \code{method = "permute"} requires specifying a few
additional arguments (e.g., the training data, target name, a prediction
function, etc.); see \code{?vi\_permute} for details.

An example is given below for the previously fitted PPR and NN models.
Here we use \(R^2\) (\code{metric = "rsquared"}) as the evaluation
metric. The results, which are displayed in Figure
\ref{fig:vip-permute-ppr-nn}, agree with those obtained using the PDP-
and ICE-based methods.

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
# Plot VI scores
set.seed(2021)  # for reproducibility
p1 <- vip(pp, method = "permute", target = "y", metric = "rsquared",
          pred_wrapper = predict) + ggtitle("PPR")
p2 <- vip(nn, method = "permute", target = "y", metric = "rsquared",
          pred_wrapper = predict) + ggtitle("NN")

# Figure 11
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
\end{Sinput}
\begin{figure}[!htb]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{greenwell-boehmke_files/figure-latex/vip-permute-ppr-nn-1} 

}

\caption[Permutation-based feature importance for the PPR and NN models fit to the simulated Friedman data]{Permutation-based feature importance for the PPR and NN models fit to the simulated Friedman data.}\label{fig:vip-permute-ppr-nn}
\end{figure}
\end{Schunk}

The permutation approach introduces randomness into the procedure and
therefore should be run more than once if computationally feasible.
Fortunately, this also allows us to compute standard errors for the
estimated VI scores, as illustrated in the example below where we
specify \code{nsim = 10} to request that each feature be permuted 10
times and the results averaged together. (Additionally, if
\code{nsim > 1}, you can set \code{geom = "boxplot"} in the call to
\code{vip()} to construct boxplots of the raw permutation-based VI
scores. This is useful if you want to visualize the variability in each
of the VI estimates; see Figure \ref{fig:vip-boxplots} for an example.)

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
# Use 10 Monte Carlo reps
set.seed(403)  # for reproducibility
vis <- vi(pp, method = "permute", target = "y", metric = "rsquared",
          pred_wrapper = predict, nsim = 15)
vip(vis, geom = "boxplot")
\end{Sinput}


\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{greenwell-boehmke_files/figure-latex/vip-boxplots-1} \end{center}

\end{Schunk}

All available performance metrics for regression and classification can
be listed using the \code{list\_metrics()} function, for example:

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
list_metrics()
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
#>      Metric                       Description                             Task

#> 5      mauc Multiclass area under (ROC) curve        Multiclass classification
#> 6       mae               Mean absolute error                       Regression
#> 7       mse                Mean squared error                       Regression
#> 8        r2                         R squared                       Regression
#> 9  rsquared                         R squared                       Regression
#> 10     rmse           Root mean squared error                       Regression
#> 11      sse             Sum of squared errors                       Regression
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}

We can also use a custom metric (i.e., loss function). Suppose for
example you want to measure importance using the
\dfn{mean absolute error} (MAE):

\begin{equation}
  MAE = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n\left|Y_i - \widehat{f}\left(\boldsymbol{X}_i\right)\right|,
\end{equation}

where \(\widehat{f}\left(\boldsymbol{X}_i\right)\) is the predicted
value of \(Y_i\). A simple function implementing this metric is given
below (note that, according to the documentation in \code{?vi\_permute},
this function requires two arguments: \code{actual} and
\code{predicted}).

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
mae <- function(actual, predicted) {
  mean(abs(actual - predicted))
}
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}

To use this for computing permutation-based VI scores just pass it via
the \code{metric} argument (be warned, however, that the metric used for
computing permutation importance should be the same as the metric used
to train and tune the model). Also, since this is a custom metric, we
need to specify whether a smaller value indicates better performance by
setting \code{smaller\_is\_better = TRUE}. The results, which are
displayed in Figure \ref{fig:vip-nn-mae}, are similar to those in Figure
\ref{fig:vip-permute-ppr-nn}, albeit a different scale.

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
# Figure 12
set.seed(2321)  # for reproducibility
pfun <- function(object, newdata)  predict(object, newdata = newdata)
vip(nn, method = "permute", target = "y", metric = mae,
    smaller_is_better = TRUE, pred_wrapper = pfun) +
  ggtitle("Custom loss function: MAE")
\end{Sinput}


\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{greenwell-boehmke_files/figure-latex/vip-nn-mae-1} \end{center}

\end{Schunk}

Although permutation importance is most naturally computed on the
training data, it may also be useful to do the shuffling and measure
performance on new data! This is discussed in depth in
\citet{molnar-2019-iml}{[}Chapter 5, Section 5.2{]}. For users
interested in computing permutation importance using new data, just
supply it to the \code{train} argument in the call to \code{vi()},
\code{vip()}, or \code{vi\_permute()}. For instance, suppose we wanted
to only use a fraction of the original training data to carry out the
computations. In this case, we could simply pass the sampled data to the
\code{train} argument as follows:

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
# Figure 13
set.seed(2327)  # for reproducibility
vip(nn, method = "permute", pred_wrapper = pfun, target = "y", metric = "rmse",
    train = trn[sample(nrow(trn), size = 400), ])  # sample 400 observations
\end{Sinput}
\begin{figure}[!htb]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{greenwell-boehmke_files/figure-latex/vip-permute-nn-sample-1} 

}

\caption[Permutation-based feature importance for the NN model fit to the simulated Friedman data]{Permutation-based feature importance for the NN model fit to the simulated Friedman data.

\end{figure}
\begin{Sinput}
  ggtitle("Using a random subset of training data")
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
#> $title
#> [1] "Using a random subset of training data"
#> 
#> attr(,"class")
#> [1] "labels"
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}

When using the permutation method with \code{nsim > 1}, the default is
to keep all the permutation scores as an attribute called
\code{"raw\_scores"}; you can turn this behavior off by setting
\code{keep = FALSE} in the call to \code{vi\_permute()}, \code{vi()}, or
\code{vip()}. If \code{keep = TRUE} and \code{nsim > 1}, you can request
all permutation scores to be plotted by setting
\code{all\_permutation = TRUE} in the call to \code{vip()} as
demonstrated in the code chunk below (see Figure
\ref{fig:vip-nn-mae-all}). This let's you visually inspect the
variability in the permutation scores within each feature.

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
# Figure 14
set.seed(8264)  # for reproducibility
vip(nn, method = "permute", pred_wrapper = pfun, target = "y", metric = "mae", 
    geom = "point", all_permutations = TRUE, jitter = TRUE) +
  ggtitle("Plotting all permutation scores")
\end{Sinput}

\end{figure}
\end{Schunk}

\subsubsection{Benchmarks}

In this section, we compare the performance of three implementations of
permutation-based VI scores: \code{iml::FeatureImp()} (version 0.9.0),
\code{ingredients::feature\_importance()} (version 0.5.0), and
\code{vip::vi()} (version 0.1.3.9000).

We simulated 10,000 training observations from the Friedman 1 benchmark
problem and trained a random forest using the \pkg{ranger} package. For
each implementation, we computed permutation-based VI scores 100 times
using the \CRANpkg{microbenchmark} package \citep{microbenchmark-pkg}.
For this benchmark we did not use any of the parallel processing
capability available in the \pkg{iml} and \pkg{vip} implementations. The
results from \pkg{microbenchmark} are displayed in Figure
\ref{fig:benchmark} and summarized in the output below. In this case,
the \pkg{vip} package (version 0.1.4) was the most efficient, followed
closely by \pkg{ingredients}. It should be noted, however, that the
implementations in \pkg{vip} and \pkg{iml} can be parallelized. To the
best of our knowledge, this is not the case for \pkg{ingredients}.

\end{figure}
\end{Schunk}

\subsection{Shapley method}

Starting with \pkg{vip} 0.1.4 you can now construct VI scores based on
the popular \dfn{Shapley values}
\citet[Chapter 5, Section 5.9]{molnar-2019-iml}---a method from
coalitional game theory. Using Shapley values, the prediction for a
single instance \(x^\star\) can be explained by assuming that each
feature value in \(x^\star\) is a ``player'' in a game with a payout
equal to the corresponding prediction
\(\widehat{f}\left(x^\star\right)\). Shapley values tell us how to
fairly distribute the ``payout'' among the features. The Shapley-based
variable importance for a particular feature is computes as the mean of
the abosulte value of the iindividual Shapley values across the entire
training set. Although Shapley values can be computationally expensive,
the \CRANpkg{fastshap} package \citep{fastshap-pkg} exploits a few
computational tricks and also includes the option to perform
computations in parallel. Also, fast and exact algorithms
\citep{lundberg-explainable-2019} can be exploited for certain classes
of models, which is illustrated below using the well-known Boston
housing data (Figure \ref{fig:vi-shap}); see \code{?fastshap::explain}
for details. (\strong{Note:} specifying \texttt{include\_type\ =\ TRUE}
in the call to \texttt{vip::vip()} causes the type of variable
importance computed to be displayed as part of the axis label.)

\section{Use sparklines to characterize feature effects}

Starting with \pkg{vip} 0.1.3, we have included a new function
\code{add\_sparklines()} for constructing HTML-based VI tables; however,
this feature requires the \CRANpkg{DT} package \citep{DT-pkg}. The
primary difference between \code{vi()} and \code{add\_sparklines()} is
that the latter includes an \code{Effect} column that displays a
sparkline representation of the partial dependence function for each
feature. This is a concise way to display both feature importance and
feature effect information in a single (interactive) table. See
\code{?vip::add\_sparklines} for details. We illustrate the basic use of
\code{add\_sparklines()} in the code chunks below.

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
# First, compute a tibble of variable importance scores using any method
var_imp <- vi(rfo)

# Next, convert to an html-based data table with sparklines
add_sparklines(var_imp, fit = rfo)
\end{Sinput}

\section{Ames housing example}

For illustration, we'll use the Ames housing data which are available in
the \CRANpkg{AmesHousing} package \citep{AmesHousing-pkg}. These data
describe the sale of individual residential properties in Ames, Iowa
from 2006--2010. The data set contains 2930 observations, 80 features
(23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous), and a
continuous target giving the sale price of the home. The version we'll
load is a cleaned up version of the original data set and treats all
categorical variables as nominal (see \code{?AmesHousing::make\_ames}
for details).

Using the R package \CRANpkg{SuperLearner} \citep{SuperLearner-pkg}, we
trained five models using 5-fold cross-validation: a GBM using the
\CRANpkg{xgboost} package \citep{xgboost-pkg}, an RF using the
\CRANpkg{ranger} package \citep{ranger-pkg}, a MARS model using the
\pkg{earth} package, a GLMNET model using the \CRANpkg{glmnet} package
\citep{glmnet-pkg}, and a support vector regression model using the
\CRANpkg{kernlab} package \citep{kernlab-pkg}. The coefficients from the
meta learner indicate that the GBM contributes the most to new
predictions, followed by the MARS model, RF, and the GLMNET. The support
vector regression model did not contribute to the ensemble.

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
# Load the Ames housing data
ames <- AmesHousing::make_ames()
X <- subset(ames, select = -Sale_Price)
y <- ames$Sale_Price

# Load required packages
library(SuperLearner)

# List of base learners
learners <- c("SL.xgboost", "SL.ranger", "SL.earth", "SL.glmnet", "SL.ksvm")

# Stack models
set.seed(840)
ctrl <- SuperLearner.CV.control(V = 5L, shuffle = TRUE)
sl <- SuperLearner(Y = y, X = X, SL.library = learners, verbose = TRUE,
                   cvControl = ctrl)
sl
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
#> 
#> Call:  
#> SuperLearner(Y = y, X = X, SL.library = learners, verbose = TRUE, cvControl = ctrl) 
#> 
#> 
#> 
#>                      Risk       Coef
#> SL.xgboost_All  569646381 0.43455425
#> SL.ranger_All   666208088 0.06970309
#> SL.earth_All    553872844 0.49574265
#> SL.glmnet_All   908881559 0.00000000
#> SL.ksvm_All    6784289108 0.00000000
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}

In the code chunks below we request permutation-based VI scores and add
sparkline representations of the PDPs for the top ten features. For this
we need to define a couple of wrapper functions. One for computing
predictions (for the permutation VI scores) and one for computing
averaged predictions (for the PDPs):

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
# Prediction wrapper functions
imp_fun <- function(object, newdata) {  # for permutation-based VI scores
  predict(object, newdata = newdata)$pred
}
par_fun <- function(object, newdata) {  # for PDPs
  mean(predict(object, newdata = newdata)$pred)
}
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}

To speed up the process, we perform the computations in parallel by
setting \code{parallel = TRUE} in the call to \code{vi()} and
\code{add\_sparklines()}. Note that we first need to set up a parallel
backend for this to work. Both \pkg{vip} and \pkg{pdp} use
\CRANpkg{plyr} \citep{plyr-pkg}---which relies on \CRANpkg{foreach}
\citep{foreach-pkg}---so any parallel backend supported by the
\pkg{foreach} package should work. Below we use a \dfn{socket} approach
with the \CRANpkg{doParallel} backend \citep{doParallel-pkg} using a
cluster of size five.

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
# Setup parallel backend
library(doParallel) # load the parallel backend
cl <- makeCluster(5) # use 5 workers
registerDoParallel(cl) # register the parallel backend

# Permutation-based feature importance
set.seed(278)
var_imp <- vi(sl, method = "permute", train = X, target = y, metric = "rmse",
              pred_wrapper = imp_fun, nsim = 5, parallel = TRUE)

# Add sparkline representation of feature effects
add_sparklines(var_imp[1L:10L, ], fit = sl, pred.fun = par_fun, train = X,
               digits = 2, verbose = TRUE, trim.outliers = TRUE,
               grid.resolution = 20, parallel = TRUE)
\end{Sinput}

\section{Summary}

VIPs help to visualize the strength of the relationship between each
feature and the response, while accounting for all the other features in
the model. We've discussed two types of VI: model-specific and
model-agnostic, as well as some of their strengths and weaknesses. In
this paper, we showed how to construct VIPs for various types of ``black
box'' models in R using the \pkg{vip} package. We also briefly discussed
related approaches available in other R packages. Suggestions to avoid
high execution times were discussed and demonstrated via examples. This
paper is based on \pkg{vip} version 0.1.3. For updates that have
occurred since then, see the package's
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vip/news/news.html}{NEWS file}.
In terms of future development, \pkg{vip} can be expanded in a number of
ways. For example, we plan to incorporate the option to compute
group-based permutation scores. We're also working on including a new
option for efficiently computing Shapley-based VI scores via the new
\href{https://github.com/bgreenwell/fastshap}{fastshap} package.
Although not discussed in this paper, the package also includes a
promising statistic (similar to the PDP- and ICE-based VI scores
previously discussed) for measuring the relative strength of interaction
between features.
